# PiSaz: Build Your PC Online Store Database System

PiSaz is an online platform specializing in computer parts sales, gaining significant popularity in recent years. This project focuses on designing and deploying a comprehensive and user-friendly database system for PiSaz to replace its outdated paper-based records.
Introduction

Currently, PiSaz relies on manual record-keeping for managing its growing customer base and inventory. While this approach has worked in the past, the increasing demand and volume of data have made it unsustainable. Our team of enthusiastic computer science students from Bu-Ali Sina University has volunteered to take on the challenge of building a robust and efficient database system—free of charge—to streamline operations and enhance scalability.
Goals

    Replace the manual record-keeping system with a reliable and well-structured database.
    Design a cost-effective solution that aligns with PiSaz's budget-conscious approach.
    Provide a scalable and maintainable system that supports the company’s growing needs.
    Deliver a functional and easy-to-use system with documentation and examples.

# System Overview

PiSaz operates as an online store, allowing customers to browse, select, and purchase computer components to build custom PCs. The new database system will manage the following key areas:

    Customer Management
    Track user information, order history, and preferences.

    Inventory Management
    Keep detailed records of available computer components, such as processors, GPUs, RAM, and storage.
